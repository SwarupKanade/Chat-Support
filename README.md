# Chat Support
It is Previous version of ChatApp But Automated Functionality Added.

Here we built a chatbot with some CSS styling, made front-end AJAX calls with JavaScript, handled queries with PHP script, and stored all messages in a MySQL database.

Users in both business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) environments increasingly use chatbot virtual assistants to handle simple tasks. Adding chatbot assistants reduces overhead costs, uses support staff time better and enables organizations to provide customer service during hours when live agents aren't available.
